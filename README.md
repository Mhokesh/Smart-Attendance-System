OVERVIEW :

The Smart Attendance System is an innovative solution designed to streamline the attendance-taking
process in educational institutions using AI-based facial recognition technology. The system captures realtime video streams, detects student faces, and matches them with pre-stored images, marking their
attendance automatically without the need for manual intervention. Once a student is recognized, the system
updates the attendance record and sends an email notification to the student's parents, confirming their
presence. Additionally, an attendance report is generated and sent to the staff at the end of the day for
efficient tracking and record-keeping. The system is built with Flask for the web interface, OpenCV and
face_recognition for facial detection and recognition, and SMTP for email communication. This approach
ensures accuracy, reduces human error, and significantly improves the efficiency of attendance management, providing a seamless solution for both students and faculty
